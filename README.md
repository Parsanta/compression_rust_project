#compression_rust_project
compression_rust_project is a basic Rust project designed for practicing and showcasing Rust skills. This project focuses on creating a large file with randomly generated characters and then compressing it by removing consecutive characters.

Purpose
The primary objectives of this project are:

To practice Rust programming and develop proficiency in the language.
To demonstrate skills related to file handling, random data generation, and character compression in Rust.
Project Overview
This Rust project accomplishes the following tasks:

Generate Random Characters: It creates a large file filled with randomly generated characters. This step simulates the creation of a data source that needs compression.

Compression: The project then employs a compression algorithm to remove consecutive duplicate characters from the generated file. This step showcases the application of Rust in data manipulation and compression techniques.
